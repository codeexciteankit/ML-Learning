ðŸ”¥ What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a high-performance numerical computation library that:
Replaces Python lists for mathematical & data-heavy operations
Makes Python run 10xâ€“100x faster
Is the foundation of Machine Learning, AI, Data Science, Image Processing, Finance, and even DSA optimization
Without NumPy â†’ You canâ€™t become industry-level in Python.

ðŸš€ Why NumPy is Faster than Python List?
Python List	NumPy Array
Stores data randomly	Stores data in continuous memory (C)
Slow in loops	Super fast (no loops needed)
Python-level	C-level (machine optimized)
Bad for big data	Made for AI, ML, Data, Performance
