ðŸ”¥ What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a high-performance numerical computation library that:
Replaces Python lists for mathematical & data-heavy operations
Makes Python run 10xâ€“100x faster
Is the foundation of Machine Learning, AI, Data Science, Image Processing, Finance, and even DSA optimization
Without NumPy â†’ You canâ€™t become industry-level in Python.

ðŸš€ Why NumPy is Faster than Python List?
Python List	NumPy Array
Stores data randomly	Stores data in continuous memory (C)
Slow in loops	Super fast (no loops needed)
Python-level	C-level (machine optimized)
Bad for big data	Made for AI, ML, Data, Performance

NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.


Dimensions in Arrays
A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).
nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements.

0-D Arrays
0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.

1-D Arrays
An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.
These are the most common and basic arrays.

2-D Arrays
An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.
These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.

NumPy has a whole sub module dedicated towards matrix operations called numpy.mat

3-D arrays
An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.
These are often used to represent a 3rd order tensor.
